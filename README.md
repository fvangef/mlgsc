MLGSC - Maximum-likelihood  general sequence classifier
=====

MLGSC is a set of programs for classifying sequences according to OTU. It
consists of the following:

* `mlgsc_train`: trains a classifier using an alignment and a phylogenetic tree
* `mlgsc`: classifies unknown sequences according to a classifier produced by
  `mlgsc_train`.
