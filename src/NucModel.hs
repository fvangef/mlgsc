-- A model for a conserved region of nucleic acid of length L. 

{- This model uses a 2D array (more precisely, a Vector of Vectors). The outer
 - vector must be boxed, as it contains other vectors; the inner vectors can be
 - unboxed, since they contain numbers (i.e. positional scores of nucleotides).
 -
 - Since unboxed vectors are more efficient than boxed ones, (see e.g.
 - http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Numeric_Haskell:_A_Vector_Tutorial#Boxed_Arrays:_Data.Vector),
 - I will have a short outer vector (one per nucleotide) of long inner
 - vectors (indexed by position) of integers. 
 -
 - E.g. (where '<>' denote vectors):
 -  <
 -   <0,3,5,2>, -- A
 -   <3,6,6,3>, -- C
 -   <1,3,5,2>, -- G
 -   <2,6,8,1>  -- T
